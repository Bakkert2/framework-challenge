        <h3>HI! WE'RE THE WATER BEARS TEAM!</h3>
        <p>What started out as small group in a school group project turned quickly into a small band of close friends, and one that had some great success when working together on games.</p>
        <p>We formed Water Bears Interactve Arts as a way to continue working on our games that we made at some point as portfolio projects, but now fully back and enjoy creating.</p>

        <h2>THE GAME</h2>
        <p>Over the course of about 10 months, only about 3-4 of which were active dev time, this small group of 7 people were able to turn our small group project into a fully realised and released game.</p>
        <p>We found a niche, of a style of games much like old tavern flash games, such as the Papa's series, and decided to tap into that market. We created woodland creatures, gave them personalities, and wrote personal stories for them all. We called it:</p>
        <img src="Header Capsule.png" alt="Bearly Baking character portrait">
        <p>Fully written, fully voice acted, full heart. We love this project, and can't wait to see what we can come up with once we eventually find the time to make another one.</p>

        <h3>Until then: Have a seat. Your muffins will be right out :)</h3>
