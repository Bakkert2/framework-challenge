        <h3>HI! WE'RE THE WATER BEARS TEAM!</h3>
        <p>What started out as small group in a school group project turned quickly into a small band of close friends, and one that had some great success when working together on games.</p>
        <p>We formed Water Bears Interactve Arts as a way to continue working on our games that we made at some point as portfolio projects, but now fully back and enjoy creating.</p>
